## Evaluate

### Entropy
- Random Entropy
- Uncorrelated Entropy
- Real Entropy
Run 
```
python example/run_entropy.py
```
for examples of calculating entropy for location traces. 

### Location frquency
Run 
```
python example/run_loc_f.py
```
for examples of calculating location visitation frquency. 

### Radius of gyration
Run 
```
